# Angular and TypeScript Bare Bones Project

The Bare Bones project is an Angular starter project that has the npm modules, 
configuration, scripts, folders and routing in place.

Here's what is in the project:

* Angular scripts and TypeScript configuration are ready to go
* Angular bootstrapper wired up to the app component
* App component with basic routing applied
* Homepage component 
* A single "feature" component (represents a custom feature your app would have)
* A simple data service to provide data and show dependency injection
* Routing between the homepage and the "feature"
* Bootstrap for CSS

It's a minimal app intended to get you up and running quickly so the rest is up to you!

If you're using VS Code, install my [Angular code snippets](https://blog.codewithdan.com/2017/04/01/angular-2-typescript-and-html-snippets-for-vs-code/) 
to simplify the process of writing Angular code. The code snippets make it easy
to build Angular components, services, pipes, directives and more.
